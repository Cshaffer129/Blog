  <h1> My way of a growth mindset</h1>
</header>
<p> A growth mindset to me is a mindset that strives for greatness no matter how hopeless the situation may feel hopeless</p>

3 reminders that i would use to keep myself in a good mindset is
<ul>
  <li>Keep practicing or ask for help</li>
  <li>Acknowledge my problem with the assignment</li>
  <li>Take notes on assingments i think i may miss</li>
</ul>
